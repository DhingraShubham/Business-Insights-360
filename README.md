**Introduction**
- AtliQ Hardware is one of the fastest-growing companies in the electronics market operating throughout the globe.
- AtliQ is leading manufacturer and supplier of computer hardware  and selling products like PCs, printers, and accessories through channels & stores like Croma and BestBuy, as well as through platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.

**Problem Statement**
AtliQ Hardware has experienced rapid growth in recent years, establishing itself as one of the fastest-growing hardware companies. However, despite this success, the company has faced significant financial setbacks in the LATAM region, primarily due to ineffective decision-making based on Excel analyses, conducted surveys, and intuition-driven approaches.
Recognizing the need for data-driven strategies, the senior management now aims to integrate a dedicated Data Analytics team within the organization, leveraging Power BI to enhance decision-making capabilities and drive informed business outcomes.

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI to ensure data transparency and enable accurate, data-driven decision-making. With competitors expanding rapidly and intensifying market competition, it has become imperative to conduct precise data analysis and implement strategic, data-backed decisions to maintain a competitive edge.
